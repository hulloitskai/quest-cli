## FAQ

#### Will this steal my Quest login?

Yes.

Okay, not really, but don't take that from me; check the source code for
yourself:

- [`quest-cli/internal/interact/quest.go`](https://github.com/stevenxie/quest-cli/blob/master/internal/interact/quest.go)
- [`uwquest/login.go`](https://github.com/stevenxie/uwquest/blob/master/login.go) (underlying Quest accessor library)

Your credentials are sent to the UWaterloo IDP (ID portal) as if you're
logging into the Quest website itself.
